# TrustVC W3C CLI

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED PACKAGE**
> 
> This CLI package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. The CLI was built using legacy BBS+ cryptosuites that have been superseded by modern W3C Data Integrity cryptosuites (ECDSA-SD-2023, BBS-2023).

## Legacy Documentation

`w3c-cli` is a command-line interface tool designed to demonstrate how to interact with Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) using functions from the following repositories:

- [`w3c-issuer`](https://github.com/TrustVC/w3c/tree/main/packages/w3c-issuer)
- [`w3c-vc`](https://github.com/TrustVC/w3c/tree/main/packages/w3c-vc)
- [`w3c-credential-status`](https://github.com/TrustVC/w3c/tree/main/packages/w3c-credential-status)

This CLI provides a quick and straightforward way for users to:
- Create key pairs
- Generate well-known DIDs
- Generate a signed Credential Status
- Sign and verify VCs via the command line.

## Installation
1. Install CLI:

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to install the cli globally

```sh
npm install -g @trustvc/w3c-cli
```

2. Run the CLI commands as needed:

```sh
w3c-cli <command>
```

## How It Works
- **Generating Key Pairs**: The CLI utilizes the `generateKeyPair` function from the `w3c-issuer` repository to generate key pairs, These key pairs are essential for creating DIDs and signing VCs.

- **Generating Well-Known DID**: The CLI uses the `issueDID` function from the `w3c-issuer`repository to generate a well-known DID. This allows users to self-host their DID as a unique identifier in decentralized systems.

- **Signing Verifiable Credentials**: The CLI digitally signs a Verifiable Credential using the `signCredential` function from the `w3c-vc` repository, ensuring that the credential is tamper-evident and can be trusted by external verifiers.

- **Verifying Verifiable Credentials**: The CLI verifies the authenticity of a signed Verifiable Credential using the `verifyCredential` function from the `w3c-vc` repository, checking the cryptographic proof to ensure the credential has not been altered and confirming the validity of the issuer's signature.

- **Generating a Signed Credential Status**: The CLI creates a Bitstring `StatusList` from the `w3c-credential-status` repository and uses the `createCredentialStatusPayload` function to generate the pre-signed VC. It is then signed with the `signCredential` function from the `w3c-vc` repository, returning a signed Credential Status VC, which users can self-host.

- **Updating a Signed Credential Status**: The CLI updates a signed Credential Status VC by downloading the hosted Credential Status VC. It then validates and parses the Bitstring `StatusList`, iteratively updating the `StatusList`, and signing the updated Credential Status using the `signCredential` function from the `w3c-vc` repository. Finally, it returns an updated signed Credential Status VC, which users can self-host.

## Commands
The CLI provides several commands to help users interact with DIDs and Verifiable Credentials:

### `w3c-cli key-pair`
This command generates a DID key pair, importing functions from the `w3c-issuer` repository. The generated key pairs are used to create DIDs and sign VCs.

### `w3c-cli did`
This command generates a well-known DID using functionality from the `w3c-issuer` repository, allowing users to self-host their own DID.

### `w3c-cli sign`
The sign command digitally signs a Verifiable Credential, leveraging the `w3c-vc` repository to create cryptographic proofs for the credentials, ensuring that the data remains tamper-evident and can be verified by any party.

### `w3c-cli verify`
This command verifies the authenticity of a signed Verifiable Credential using the cryptographic proofs generated by the `w3c-vc` repository. It ensures that the credential has not been altered and confirms the validity of the issuer’s signature.

### `w3c-cli credential-status create`
This command creates a signed Credential Status VC using the Bitstring StatusList.

### `w3c-cli credential-status update`
This command updates any existing Credential Status VC and resign the Credential Status after it has been updated.

## Directory Structure
Each command file is located in the `src/commands` directory and imports relevant functions from the `w3c-issuer`, `w3c-vc` and `w3c-credential-status` repositories.
