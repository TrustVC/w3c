# w3c-cli

`w3c-cli` is a command-line interface tool designed to demonstrate how to interact with verifiable credentials and DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) using functions from the `w3c-issuer` and `w3c-vc` repositories. This CLI serves as a quick and straightforward way for users to generate well-known DIDs, create DID key pairs, and sign and verify verifiable credentials via the command line.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd w3c-cli
```
2. Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3. Run the CLI commands as needed:
```sh
npm run dev <command>
```

## How It Works
- **Generating Well-Known DID**: The CLI uses the `issueDID` function from the `w3c-issuer`repository to generate a well-known DID. This allows users to self-host their DID, serving as a unique identifier in decentralized systems.

- **Generating DID Key Pairs**: The CLI utilizes the `generateKeyPair` function from the `w3c-issuer` repository to generate DID key pairs. These key pairs are essential for both creating and signing DIDs, as well as for signing Verifiable Credentials (VCs).

- **Signing Verifiable Credentials**: Using the `signCredential` function from the `w3c-vc` repository, the CLI digitally signs a Verifiable Credential, ensuring that the credential is tamper-evident and can be trusted by external verifiers.

- **Verifying Verifiable Credentials:**: The `verifyCredential` function from the `w3c-vc` repository verifies the authenticity of a signed Verifiable Credential by checking the cryptographic proof, ensuring that the credential has not been altered and confirming the validity of the issuer’s signature.

## Commands
The CLI provides several commands to help users interact with DIDs and Verifiable Credentials:
### `npm run dev did`
This command generates a well-known DID using functionality from the `w3c-issuer` repository, allowing users to self-host their own DID.

### `npm run dev generate`
This command generates a DID key pair, importing functions from the `w3c-issuer` repository. The key pairs are used for creating and signing DIDs, as well as for signing verifiable credentials.

### `npm run dev sign`
The sign command allows you to digitally sign a Verifiable Credential. It leverages the `w3c-vc` repository to create cryptographic proofs for the credentials, ensuring that the data remains tamper-evident and can be verified by any trusted party.

### `npm run dev verify`
This command verifies the authenticity of a signed Verifiable Credential using the cryptographic proofs generated by the `w3c-vc` repository. It ensures that the credential has not been altered and confirms the validity of the issuer’s signature.

## Directory Structure
Each command file (`did.ts`, `generate.ts`, `sign.ts`, `verify.ts`) is located in the `src/commands` directory and imports relevant functions from the `w3c-issuer` and `w3c-vc` repositories.
